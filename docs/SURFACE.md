# SURFACE — verified third-party facts

Append-only. Newest dated entry wins. Nothing goes in here from model memory: every entry is
checked against the vendor's docs or a live call, and says which. Rule in `CLAUDE.md`.

## zod 4.5.4 — 2026-09-08, verified by live call (`node` against the installed package)

Used by `packages/protocol`. Zod 4 moved several things that Zod 3 habits get wrong.

| Fact | Result |
|---|---|
| Top-level format helpers exist | `z.uuid()`, `z.email()`, `z.url()`, `z.int()`, `z.iso.date()`, `z.iso.datetime()` |
| Chained v3 forms still exist | `z.string().email()`, `z.string().datetime()`, `z.number().int()` — deprecated, do not use |
| `z.iso.datetime()` accepts | `2026-09-08T10:00:00Z` yes; `+02:00` only with `{ offset: true }`; bare local time no |
| `z.record(value)` with one argument | Accepted at runtime; always pass the key type: `z.record(z.string(), value)` |
| `z.record(enum, v)` | **Requires every enum member.** A subset fails to parse |
| `z.partialRecord(enum, v)` | Subset allowed, unknown keys rejected — this is what partial maps want |
| Unknown keys on `z.object` | Stripped, not rejected. `z.strictObject` rejects them |
| Recursion | `z.lazy(() => …)` works; annotate the const with `z.ZodType<T>` to break the type cycle |
| `z.custom<T>(guard)` | Runs the guard; use for in-process values like `Float32Array` |
| Errors | `ZodError`, `error.issues[0]` is `{ code, expected, path, message }`; `z.prettifyError`, `z.treeifyError` |
| `.readonly()` | Freezes the parsed output (`Object.isFrozen` true) |
| JSON Schema export | `z.toJSONSchema(schema)` exists — the path to MCP tool schemas in P5 |

## GitHub Actions used by `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — 2026-09-08, verified against the GitHub API

`actions/checkout@v7` (v7.0.1), `actions/setup-node@v7` (v7.0.0), `pnpm/action-setup@v6` (v6.1.0),
`Swatinem/rust-cache@v2` (v2.9.2), `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable` (branch exists; that repo tags by
toolchain name, not by release). First green run on `main`: 2026-09-08.

## pnpm 11.24.0 — 2026-09-08, verified by live call

`minimumReleaseAge` is on by default with roughly a 24-hour cutoff. A dependency published inside the
window fails the install unless it is listed in `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
We keep the protection and pin ranges slightly behind the newest release instead of excluding.

## Toolchain versions the gate is green against — 2026-09-08

TypeScript 7.0.2 (native port), Vite 8.2.2, Vitest 5.0.0, oxlint 1.81.0, React 19.2.8, Node 22.22.3,
rustc 1.97.1, axum 0.8.9, tokio 1.53.1.

Notes that cost time once:
- A project referenced by another `tsconfig` may not set `noEmit` (TS6310). Referenced projects are
  `composite` + `emitDeclarationOnly` into `.tsbuild/`; runtime resolution goes to `src/` through
  each package's `exports`, so there is no build step for packages.
- oxlint's `react` plugin has no `jsx-uses-react` rule; only `react/react-in-jsx-scope` needs turning
  off for the React 19 automatic runtime.
